## Randomly pick a name

<br/><p style="font-size:18pt"><b>Teacher Request</b></p>
<p style="font-size:16pt">In classroom, sometimes we use Wheel of Names as the name picker. I want to design other kinds of name pickers. It may make class activities more interesting.</p>
<br/><p style="font-size:18pt"><b>Design Thinking</b></p>
<p style="font-size:16pt">Write a program that can extract the list of students' names in the csv format. Then process the list and shuffle the order. Teachers can put a time.sleep() funtion to make changes.</p>
