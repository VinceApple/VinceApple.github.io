## CALL Community to Brainstorm

<br/><p style="font-size:16pt">In 2021, we started to hold workshops for EFL teachers. Then I created a platform to exchange ideas. We are looking forward to innovative applications. I am also looking for better ways for these EFL teachers to benefit from Python and other tech tools.</p>
