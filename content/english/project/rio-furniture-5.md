## Build an AI Interactive Chatbot 

<br/><p style="font-size:16pt">Dialogflow is a authoring tool that enables EFL teachers to customize a chatbot from scratch. Teachers can devise a general-purpose bot, a speaking-test bot, a listening-test bot, a purpose-built bot, a quiz bot, etc. They can create whatever bot they like to use in class to simulate real-life conversation or give tests to students.</p>
