## Suffle Test Questions

<br/><p style="font-size:18pt"><b>Teacher Request</b></p>
<p style="font-size:16pt">Because the students in my school are not good enough and the students are more passive in learning, I became a teacher who gave out small exam papers to students in every class, and because I had to teach different grades at the same time, the amount of lesson preparation every day was huge. In order to help students memorize vocabulary, I will repeat the test every few days for vocabulary in the same range. When issuing a small vocabulary test paper, I need to change the order of the questions on the same test paper. I hope Python can help me handle this tedious repetition. You can press a key to automatically arrange all the questions in the examination paper randomly, without manually moving them around. In addition, the corresponding answer to each question can also be automatically generated, which makes it more convenient for me to help students correct the answer.</p>
<br/><p style="font-size:18pt"><b>Design Thinking</b></p>
<p style="font-size:16pt">Write a program that can read a file containing test questions. The program then shuffles the order of each question and produces a new file in which all the questions are shuffled.</p>
