## Google Speech-to-Text Service

<br/><p style="font-size:16pt">An EFL teacher was doing research. She collected some interview recordings. Manually transcribing these audio files is really a waste of time. With Python, we wrote a program automatically converting audio files into texts, which saved lots of time. Teacher Lu could directly check the transcription and do coding.</p>
