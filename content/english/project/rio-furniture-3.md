## Converting texts to audio files through Python

<br/><p style="font-size:16pt">Azure provides service to convert texts to speech. They claim that they use AI technology, which enables the voice to be as natural as possible. Using Python and Azure TTS API makes it easier to create a conversation audio file. EFL teachers can write scripts on their own. They do not need to find a native speaker to do recording. Azure TTS converts whatever you type to natural human voice.</p>
